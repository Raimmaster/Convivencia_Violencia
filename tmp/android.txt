I'm compiling a short test program, to see if you have a working JDK on your
system.





I was unable to use javac to compile a test file. If you haven't installed
the Java Development Kit yet, please download it from:

http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html

The JDK is different from the JRE, so it's possible you have Java
without having the JDK. Without a working JDK, I can't continue.
